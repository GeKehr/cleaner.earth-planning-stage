# Scenario 02: Support Teams

## Precondition:

Ally Has signed up for a 4â‚¬/month subscription. She is mainly interested in beach clean up projects.

## Sequence of Steps:

1. Ally Opens http://cleaner.earth/
2. On the Impact Screen she selects: 'clean ups' from a list of categories
3. All the projects that are not clean up projects get hidden and the most popular clean up is set as the bottom sheet
4. She already knows about this clean up so she taps the <3 (quick support) button five times to support this team by a set amount each time. Little numbers according to her support are emitted from the button.
5. She then swipes through the project(while the map changes accordingly) until she finds one that piques her interest
6. She swipes up on the bottom sheet to get more information.
7. She reads the description which is followed by a short Instagram Style feed.
8. She taps 'full feed' which makes the feed expand and turn into an infinite scroll feed
9. Ally likes what she sees turns the support dial up to 30 mins and taps 'go'

## Postcondition:

Ally has spent all her time available and, is happy about it and learnt something new about a team on the Philippines as well.
